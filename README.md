Welcome to the AI Prompt Engineering Frameworks repository! ðŸš€
This guide provides structured formulas to craft effective AI prompts for better responses.

ðŸ“Œ Prompt Formulas

ðŸ”· P.R.I.S.M. Formula

(Perfecting Requests for Intelligent System Mastery)

1. Precision â€“ Clearly define the task and expected outcome.


2. Relevance â€“ Ensure the request aligns with the AIâ€™s capabilities.


3. Instructions â€“ Provide step-by-step details or constraints.


4. Structure â€“ Specify the output format (list, summary, essay, etc.).


5. Modifications (Optional) â€“ Allow room for refinement or re-prompting.



Example Prompt:

Generate a concise, 100-word summary of the history of quantum computing in bullet points.

ðŸ”· B.R.I.D.G.E. Framework

(Building Responses with Intelligent Directives, Guidance & Examples)

1. Background â€“ Provide context on the topic.


2. Request â€“ Clearly state what you need.


3. Interaction â€“ Define the tone or depth (simple vs. advanced).


4. Details â€“ Add specifics like examples, citations, or step-by-step breakdowns.


5. Goal â€“ Explain the intended use (teaching, research, debate, etc.).


6. Enhancements (Optional) â€“ Ask for analogies, storytelling, or visuals.



Example Prompt:

Explain the Turing Test in simple terms for a high school audience, using an analogy with a detective solving a mystery.

ðŸ”· A.R.T. Prompting Formula

(Adaptive Requests for Tailored AI Responses)

1. Audience â€“ Define who the response is for (beginner, expert, child).


2. Requirements â€“ Specify format, length, and level of depth.


3. Tone â€“ Choose a style (formal, casual, humorous, storytelling).



Example Prompt:

Describe machine learning in a fun and engaging way, using a superhero analogy for a 12-year-old.
